Prompt

You are given a **working baseline React.js application** for an online courses website.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

### Baseline Functionality (Already Implemented)

* Pages:

  * Home
  * About
  * Courses
  * Contact
* Navigation bar for page switching
* Courses page shows a simple list of courses (title and price only)
* Local mock data, no backend
* Minimal and utilitarian UI styling

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Your Task: Improve the Existing Application

You must **extend and improve the provided baseline code**, both functionally and visually.

---

### Required Feature Improvements

#### 1. Course Detail / Landing Page

* Each course must have its own detail page
* Display:

  * Course title
  * Full description
  * Price
* Add a “Buy Course” button
  (mock behavior only; no real payment integration required)

---

#### 2. Course Feedback Feature

* Add a feedback section or a dedicated page per course
* Users must be able to submit:

  * Name (or anonymous)
  * Rating (1–5)
  * Comment
* Newly submitted feedback must appear immediately in the UI

---

#### 3. UI & Visual Improvements (Mandatory)

The improved application must be **visually cleaner and more polished** than the baseline.

Minimum expectations:

* Consistent layout, spacing, and typography across all pages
* Reusable UI components where appropriate (e.g. course cards, buttons, sections)
* Clear visual hierarchy (headings, content blocks, actions)
* Basic responsive behavior:

  * Usable on both desktop and mobile screen widths
* The UI should look **intentionally designed**, not default or placeholder-level

You are **not required to create a custom design system**, but the result must be clearly more aesthetically refined than the baseline.

---

## Constraints

* Use React.js
* Use React Router for navigation
* Do not remove or break existing pages
* No backend required (local state or mock data is sufficient)

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated React source code based on the provided baseline
* A **README.md** that includes:

  * How to install dependencies
  * How to run the project locally
  * A short summary of the improvements you made
* The README must be sufficient for a reviewer to run and verify the application

---

## Evaluation Criteria

**Pass if:**

* Improvements are clearly built on top of the baseline code
* Course detail, purchase mock, and feedback features work correctly
* UI is clearly more polished, consistent, and usable than the baseline
* Code structure remains clear and maintainable
* README allows the project to be run without guesswork

**Fail if:**

* Baseline functionality is broken
* The application is rewritten instead of incrementally improved
* UI remains essentially unchanged or visually careless
* Features are described but not actually implemented
* README is missing or insufficient
