Prompt

You are given a **working baseline React.js application** for an online courses website.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

### Baseline Functionality (Already Implemented)

* Pages: Home, About, Courses, Contact
* Navigation bar for page switching
* Courses page shows a simple list of courses (title and price)
* Local mock data embedded in App.jsx
* Clean and minimal UI styling
* All components in a single App.jsx file for simplicity

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Your Task: Add Improvements

You must **extend the provided baseline code** with focused improvements.

---

### Required Feature Improvements

#### 1. Course Detail Pages

* Add a description field to each course in the courses array
* Create a detail route for each course at `/courses/:id`
* Display on detail page:
  * Course title
  * Full description
  * Price
* Add a "Buy Course" button on the detail page (mock behavior with alert)
* Add navigation from course cards to detail pages

---

#### 2. Course Feedback System

* Add a feedback section on each course detail page
* Users must be able to submit:
  * Name (optional, default to "Anonymous")
  * Rating (1-5 stars)
  * Comment
* Store feedback in localStorage per course
* Display submitted feedback immediately below the form
* Show all previous feedback for that course

---

#### 3. UI Enhancements (Required)

The improved application must be **visually polished and professional**:

* Add attractive hover effects and transitions to course cards
* Use a cohesive color scheme (e.g., blue accents for interactive elements)
* Add shadows and depth to cards
* Improve typography hierarchy (font sizes, weights, spacing)
* Add icons or visual indicators where appropriate
* Ensure fully responsive layout on mobile screens
* Polish all pages (Home, About, Courses, Contact, Course Detail)
* Make buttons and interactive elements visually distinct

---

## Constraints

* You may split code into separate components if it improves clarity
* Use React.js with React Router for navigation
* Do not remove or break existing pages
* Use localStorage for feedback persistence (no backend required)
* Focus on clean, maintainable code structure

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated React source code with all improvements
* Enhanced styles.css with professional UI styling
* A **README.md** that includes:
  * How to install dependencies
  * How to run the project locally
  * A clear summary of improvements made
  * Brief explanation of how feedback works
