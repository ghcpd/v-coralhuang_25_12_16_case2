User: Prompt

You are given a **working baseline React.js application** for an online courses website.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

### Baseline Functionality (Already Implemented)

* Pages: Home, About, Courses, Contact
* Navigation bar for page switching
* Courses page shows a simple list of courses (title and price)
* Local mock data embedded in `App.jsx`
* Clean but minimal UI styling
* All components implemented in a single `App.jsx` file for simplicity

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Your Task: Add Improvements

You must **extend and improve the provided baseline code**, both visually and in terms of page content.
The goal is to turn the baseline into a **more complete and professional demo application**.

---

## Required Feature Improvements

### 1. Course Detail Pages

* Add a `description` field to each course in the courses array
* Create a detail route for each course at `/courses/:id`
* On the course detail page, display:

  * Course title
  * Full course description (multiple sentences, not a placeholder)
  * Price
* Add a clear “Buy Course” button

  * Mock behavior only (e.g. alert or inline confirmation message)
* Enable navigation from course cards on the Courses page to the corresponding detail page

---

### 2. Course Feedback System

* Add a feedback section on each course detail page
* Users must be able to submit:

  * Name (optional, default to “Anonymous”)
  * Rating (1–5 stars or equivalent UI)
  * Comment text
* Feedback requirements:

  * Store feedback in `localStorage` per course
  * Display newly submitted feedback immediately
  * Show all previous feedback entries for that course
  * Clearly separate individual feedback entries visually

---

### 3. Page Content Enhancements (All Pages)

You must **add meaningful content** to all existing pages, not just adjust styling.

#### Home Page

* Add a clear hero section including:

  * A headline describing the platform (e.g. “Learn Practical Skills Online”)
  * A short tagline or summary paragraph
  * A primary call-to-action button linking to the Courses page
* Add at least one additional section, such as:

  * Platform benefits (e.g. flexible learning, expert instructors, affordable pricing)
  * Featured courses (static selection is fine)

#### About Page

* Expand the About page with real explanatory content, such as:

  * A short paragraph describing the purpose of the platform
  * A section explaining who the courses are for
  * Optional values or mission statement
* Content should be structured with headings and sections, not a single block of text

#### Courses Page

* Improve course presentation:

  * Use course cards instead of plain lists
  * Each card should clearly show title, short description (optional), and price
  * Cards must be visually interactive (hover effects)
* Clicking a course card should navigate to the detail page

#### Contact Page

* Enhance the contact page with:

  * A short introductory text explaining how users can reach out
  * A contact form including:

    * Name
    * Email
    * Message
* Form submission can be mocked (e.g. success message on submit)
* Add basic form validation (required fields)

---

### 4. UI & Visual Enhancements (Required)

The improved application must be **visually polished and professional**, not just functional.

Minimum UI expectations:

* Consistent layout, spacing, and typography across **all pages**
* Use a cohesive color scheme (e.g. consistent accent color for buttons and links)
* Add shadows, rounded corners, and depth to cards and sections
* Clear visual hierarchy using headings, spacing, and grouping
* Buttons and interactive elements must be visually distinct
* Add subtle hover effects and transitions where appropriate
* Ensure a responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop screen sizes
* All pages (Home, About, Courses, Contact, Course Detail) must be visually improved

---

## Constraints

* Use React.js with React Router for navigation
* You may split code into multiple components if it improves clarity and structure
* Do not remove or break existing pages
* No backend required; use local state and `localStorage` only
* Focus on clean, readable, and maintainable code

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated React source code with all improvements implemented
* An enhanced `styles.css` (or equivalent) reflecting the new UI design
* A **README.md** that includes:

  * How to install dependencies
  * How to run the project locally
  * A clear summary of UI and feature improvements made
  * A brief explanation of how the feedback system works

✅ **Done!** I implemented the required feature improvements, visual polish, and documentation for the demo app.

---

## 🔍 What I changed (high level)
- **Course detail pages** with full descriptions and a mock “Buy Course” button
- **Feedback system** (per-course, stored in `localStorage`) with immediate display
- **Richer content** for Home, About, and Contact pages
- **UI polish** (consistent colors, buttons, cards, hover effects, responsive layout)
- **README** with install/run instructions and feature summary

---

## 📂 Files changed
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| App.jsx | Added `description` to course data, `CourseDetail` page, `FeedbackSection` component, richer Home/About/Contact contents, and link navigation between course cards and detail pages |
| styles.css | Added primary/secondary buttons, hero/benefit section styles, contact/feedback forms, feedback list styles, and small tweaks to cards and layout |
| README.md | Install/run instructions + notes about features/feedback system |

---

## 🔧 How to run locally (Windows)
1. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
2. Start the dev server  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open <http://localhost:5173> (Vite dev server default) to view the app.

> ⚠️ If you run into `vite` not found, run `npm install` again to install dev deps or ensure you're in the right workspace.

## ⚙️ Features & how they work
### Course Detail & Buy
- Visit `/courses/:id` (navigate from course cards)
- Shows title, full description (multi-sentence), price
- “Buy Course” button shows a (mock) alert and toggles to “Purchased”

### Feedback System
- On detail page, users can submit feedback:
  - **Name** (optional — defaults to "Anonymous")
  - **Rating** (1–5 stars)
  - **Comment** (required)
- Feedback is stored per course in localStorage under `feedback_course_{id}`
- New feedback displays immediately and existing entries are shown for the course
- UI: a visually separated feedback list

### Page content enhancements
- **Home**: hero section + CTA button + benefits cards
- **About**: mission, audience, values (headings/sections)
- **Contact**: short intro + contact form (email & message required, mock submission)

---

## 🧩 Visual & UX notes
- Consistent accent color (`#0366d6`) used for primary actions and links
- Cards have shadows/hover, responsive grid (auto-fit)
- Clear visual hierarchy with headings, spacing, borders, and subtle transitions
- All pages are responsive (mobile-friendly) via the existing `grid` and `@media` rules

---

If you want, I can add features like:
- Persisting purchased state
- Extra course fields (image, category, etc.)
- An actual backend endpoint mock
